  <p> There are also different AIs that people use. For example, what they call Cici, this can help you in your studies or research for ICT.

<p>Similar to an AI grammar checker, you can check your correct grammar effortlessly. You can more easily see and fix mistakes in your grammar by using an AI grammar checker.</p>

<p>Lastly is Meta AI, which is already in the app itself. You can see it in Messenger, IG, and some other apps. This will make it easier to use because you just use @, and it will appear. </p>
